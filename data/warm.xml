    Compressed air energy storage is a promising technology which may allow us to store energy gathered from renewable sources
    for later use. <br/><br/>However, it's not a perfect storage solution; compressing air generates heat which might be lost, and expanding
    compressed air to reclaim energy requires heat to reach max efficiency. <br/><br/>If the heat from compression can be stored
    for use during expansion, the efficiency of the system can increase dramatically.
    <br/>

    Use the air compressors to either side to explore one way that researchers are trying to store heat for later use.

    <b>Compress air in the Left Compressor…</b><br/><br/> and hold

      for 1, 2, 3. Watch the Graph and the

      Pressure Gauge respond.<br/><br/>


    <b>Notice this:</b><br/><br/> The graph and the pressure

    gauge show the air pressure rising high at

    first, but then dropping a little.<br/><br/>

    <b>What’s happening?</b><br/><br/> When you compress air,

    you generate heat and pressure. As some of

    that heat escapes through the Compressor walls

    into the surrounding air, the pressure drops a

    bit.

    <b>Expand air in the Left Cylinder.</b><br/> Watch the Left

    Graph respond.<br/><br/>

    <b>Notice this:</b><br/> The pressure and temperature

    drops. The graph returns to zero, but the

    expansion line—or bottom curve—lies

    considerably below the compression line—or

    top curve.<br/><br/>

    <b>So what?</b><br/>  The top curve of the graph

    represents your work compressing the air.

    The bottom curve represents work done by

    the air as it expands.  The area between the

    curves shows how much work you have lost in

    the compression – expansion cycle through

    heat loss.

    <b>It takes work to compress air and generate

    heat.  Lost heat is wasted work.</b>
