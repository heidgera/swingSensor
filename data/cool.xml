    Compressed air energy storage is a promising technology which may allow us to store energy gathered from renewable sources
    for later use. <br/><br/>However, it's not a perfect storage solution; compressing air generates heat which might be lost, and expanding
    compressed air to reclaim energy requires heat to reach max efficiency. <br/><br/>If the heat from compression can be stored
    for use during expansion, the efficiency of the system can increase dramatically.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Use the air compressors to either side to explore one way that researchers are trying to store heat for later use.

    <b>Compress air in the Right Compressor…</b><br/><br/> and hold

      for 1, 2, 3. Watch the Graph.<br/><br/>


    <b>Notice this:</b><br/><br/> The Right Graph doesn’t rise as

    high as the Left one did but it doesn’t fall as

    far either. Not as much heat and pressure is

    lost.<br/><br/>

    <b>What’s happening?</b><br/><br/> Find the heat sink—a

    rolled up screen in the right compressor.  The screen absorbs some

    of the heat you generate, which is then stored in the water.

    Since air in the right compressor didn’t heat up as much,

    you didn’t work as hard to

    compress it.

    <b>Notice this:</b><br/> The area between the two

    curves curves—the record of your

    work—on the Right Graph is smaller than

    this area on the Left Graph.<br/><br/>

    <b>What’s happening?</b><br/> The heat-trapping screen

    nested in the Right Compressor recycles the

    heat you generate, resulting in less wasted

    work.<br/><br/>

    <b>So what?</b><br/><br/> This experiment shows promise

    for heat-recycling research underway at the

    University of Minnesota’s Center for

    Compact and Efficient Fluid Power.

    This compressor use a column of water to compress the air inside the Compressor. As you pull down on the handle,
    the water level rises, and compresses the same amount of air into a smaller and smaller volume, which increases pressure.
    <br/><br/>
    In this compressor, there is a mesh which helps capture heat from the air during compression, and stores
    it in the water. As the air expands, this heat returns from the water, allowing more energy to be reclaimed from
    the compressed air.
