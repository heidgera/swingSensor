    <b>Compress air in the Right Compressor…</b><br />

    and hold the lever down 1..2..3.. Let go. <br /><br />
    · Watch the Air Pressure gauge<br />
    · Look at the red area in the<br /> Air Pressure vs Air Volume graph<br />
    · Repeat and watch the Air Temperature thermometer<br />
    <br />
    Notice the air pressure doesn’t rise as high in the Heat-Recovery Compressor,
    but it also doesn’t fall as far.<br /><br />

    <b>What’s happening?</b><br /><br />

    Find the heat sink. Water droplets on the screen
    store a lot of the heat that without the heat sink
    would raise the temperature of the air inside the
    cylinder. Lower air temperature means less back
    pressure — it’s easier for you to move the piston.
    Expanding the air recovers the lost heat.<br />
    <b>Smaller heat loss means less work wasted.</b>

    <b>Compress air in the Right Compressor…</b><br/><br/> and hold

      for 1, 2, 3. Watch the Graph.<br/><br/>


    <b>Notice this:</b><br/><br/> The Right Graph doesn’t rise as

    high as the Left one did but it doesn’t fall as

    far either. Not as much heat and pressure is

    lost.<br/><br/>

    <b>What’s happening?</b><br/><br/> Find the heat sink—a

    rolled up screen in the right compressor.  The screen absorbs some

    of the heat you generate, which is then stored in the water.

    Since air in the right compressor didn’t heat up as much,

    you didn’t work as hard to

    compress it.

    <b>Notice this:</b><br/> The area between the two

    curves curves—the record of your

    work—on the Right Graph is smaller than

    this area on the Left Graph.<br/><br/>

    <b>What’s happening?</b><br/> The heat-trapping screen

    nested in the Right Compressor recycles the

    heat you generate, resulting in less wasted

    work.<br/><br/>

    <b>So what?</b><br/><br/> This experiment shows promise

    for heat-recycling research underway at the

    University of Minnesota’s Center for

    Compact and Efficient Fluid Power.

    This compressor use a column of water to compress the air inside the Compressor. As you pull down on the handle,
    the water level rises, and compresses the same amount of air into a smaller and smaller volume, which increases pressure.
    <br/><br/>
    In this compressor, there is a mesh which helps capture heat from the air during compression, and stores
    it in the water. As the air expands, this heat returns from the water, allowing more energy to be reclaimed from
    the compressed air.
